 *
 * Given an integer under the binary format written as a string: "011100"
 *
 * We will do two operations:
 * - if an integer is even, divide to 2.
 * - if an integer is odd, subtract to 1.
 *
 * Then, we will do these operations until a result is 0. Calculate how many steps of these operations?
 *
 * The length of string can be [1, 1000,000]
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "011100"
 * Output: 7
